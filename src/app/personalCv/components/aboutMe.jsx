            I am Koetlisi Theko, a former BSc Mathematics and Computer Science student at the National University of Lesotho (NUL).My journey has been enriched by extensive practical experience in software development and technology.

            After leaving NUL, I embarked on a project with Enrich Holdings Company, where I developed an online voting system using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and PHP. This project not only honed my technical skills but also marked the beginning of my professional journey in the tech industry.
